code snippet for a COVID-19 prediction project using the VGG16 model. This example assumes you have a dataset of chest X-ray images categorized into 'COVID' and 'Non-COVID' classes.

Step-by-Step Guide:
Import Libraries
Set Constants and Directories
Data Augmentation and Preprocessing
Load the VGG16 Model
Build and Compile the Model
Train the Model
Evaluate the Model
Plot Training History
Generate Classification Report and Confusion Matrix
.
Key Points:
Data Augmentation: Applied extensive augmentation techniques to improve generalization.
Model Architecture: Added dropout layers to reduce overfitting.
Callbacks: Used ModelCheckpoint and EarlyStopping for optimal model training.
Evaluation: Detailed evaluation using classification report and confusion matrix.
Ensure the directories contain the appropriate images and classes. Adjust the paths and hyperparameters as needed.
